Hello Professor, I just want to say I've learned a lot in this course and I think the biggest thing I have learned is how to properly develop algorithms in a much more efficient way.
I just want to thank you for this experience as I believe it will greatly benefit me in my educational journey.
Happy Holidays.
:)
