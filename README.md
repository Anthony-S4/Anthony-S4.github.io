Please read in order to run the game properly.
This this maze game was made to show my ability to both acess and alter data at the machine level. 
At the game site below is the artwork, which must be loaded first, by pressing Load Artwork.
Then pressing Load WASM will begin the game. 
Controls for the game are arrow keys for movement.
Maze 4 is the final installation of the game but mazes 1-3 can also be loaded to view the design process and how the game evolved.
